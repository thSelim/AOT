                        Eren Yeager is a boy who lives in the town of Shiganshina, 
                        located on the outermost of three circular walls protecting their inhabitants from Titans. 
                        In the year 845, the first wall (Wall Maria) is breached by two new types of Titans, 
                        the Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan. During the incident, 
                        Eren's mother is eaten by a Smiling Titan while Eren escapes. 
                        He swears revenge on all Titans and enlists in the military along with his childhood friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert. 
                        Five years after Shiganshina's fall, the Colossal Titan attacks the city of Trost, located on the second innermost wall (Wall Rose). 
                        Eren helps to successfully defend the city after he discovers a mysterious ability to turn himself into a sentient Attack Titan. 
                        Additionally, he regains memories of his father giving him this ability shortly after the fall of Wall Maria, 
                        and telling him that the truth about their world can be found in their basement in Shiganshina. 
                        These events draw the attention of the Survey Corps and their commander, 
                        Erwin Smith, who intend to use his power to reclaim Wall Maria and reach the Yeagers' basement. 
                        Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are transferred to the Special Operations Squad, under the care of Levi Ackerman and Hange Zoë.

                <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        During an expedition into the forest between the walls, Eren and his companions encounter a sentient Female Titan, 
                        whom they later expose as their fellow military comrade Annie Leonhart. 
                        With help from his friends, Eren fights and defeats Annie, who encases herself in crystal and is put in custody. 
                        After the fight, it is discovered that there are Titans lying dormant within the walls (known as Wall Titans). 
                        Shortly thereafter, Pure Titans mysteriously appear within Wall Rose with no evidence of how they got in, accompanied by the sentient Beast Titan. 
                        Ymir, one of the new Survey Corps graduates, reveals that she can also transform into the sentient Jaw Titan, 
                        while Ymir's close friend Krista Lenz reveals herself as Historia Reiss, a member of the royal family. 
                        Two other members of the Survey Corps, Reiner Braun and Bertholt Hoover, reveal themselves as the Armored and Colossal Titan respectively. 
                        They attempt to kidnap Eren and Ymir, but fail. In the ensuing battle, Eren discovers another power within himself called "the Coordinate", 
                        that allows him to control other Titans, which he uses to kill the Smiling Titan and send a horde of Pure Titans to attack Reiner and Bertholt. 
                        This forces the two to escape, whereupon Ymir willingly flees with them, 
                        offering herself as sacrifice to prevent Historia from being targeted by the enemy. 
                        In the aftermath of these events, it is determined that the Pure Titans who suddenly appeared within Wall Rose were the inhabitants of various villages within Wall Rose, 
                        who had in some way been transformed into Titans. 
                        This leads the characters to the conclusion that all Pure Titans are, in fact, transformed human beings.

                        Eren and his friends join Levi Squad while the Survey Corps is targeted by the Military Police led by Kenny Ackerman, Levi's uncle. 
                        In the occasion, they discover that by transforming into a Pure Titan via a serum made of spinal fluid and eating another Titan shifter, 
                        a person can gain its abilities, and that Historia and her father, Rod Reiss, are the only surviving members of the royal bloodline. 
                        Rod kidnaps Eren because he is in possession of the Founding Titan, obtained by his father Grisha upon eating Frieda Reiss (Historia's half-sister), 
                        and by Eren through eating his father. Rod transforms into a monstrous Abnormal Titan, but is killed by Historia (with the help of the Survey Corps), 
                        who is thereafter declared Queen.

                    <p>
                        Having resolved the political unrest, the Survey Corps lead a successful operation to recapture Shiganshina, fighting the Beast, Colossal, Armored, 
                        and Cart Titans but suffering massive casualties, wherein Erwin dies in a suicide run against the Beast Titan, 
                        and Armin gains ownership of the Colossal Titan when Levi injects him with a serum given by Kenny, causing Armin to eat Bertholt. 
                        Eren and his companions return to his childhood home, where they discover the truth of their world: they are actually Eldians, 
                        sworn enemies of the conquering Marleyans who were enclosed within the walls after the original King Karl Fritz fled from the war. 
                        They are not the last humans as they were told, but rather an enclosed sect of Eldians on an isolated island called Paradis. 
                        Because they are "Subjects of Ymir" who can be turned into Titans by being injected with Titan spinal fluid, 
                        the Eldians continue to be oppressed by Marley. In the year after the battle of Shiganshina, 
                        the Survey Corps kill all of the remaining Pure Titans on the island.

                        Three years later, the Survey Corps attack Marley's capital, Liberio, orchestrated by Eren and his half-brother Zeke, who is the owner of the Beast Titan.
                        Eren kills Willy Tybur, an Eldian who (along with his family) had been controlling Marley from the shadows and gains ownership of the War Hammer Titan after eating its previous owner, 
                        Willy's sister Lara. However, Eren is imprisoned for acting against orders but escapes with a faction of extremist Paradis soldiers called the Yeagerists. 
                        Zeke is kept in Levi's custody but manages to escape, severely injuring but not killing him. Marley's air fleet, led by Reiner, launch an invasion of Paradis, 
                        and chaos breaks out in the ensuing battle. Eren and Zeke reunite, which leads them to the Paths—a series of gateways connecting all Eldians through time and space. 
                        There, they meet the consciousness of Ymir Fritz—the original Titan—whose tortured past led to her imprisonment within the Paths for thousands of years. 
                        Zeke attempts to convince Ymir to fulfill his wish to stop the Subjects of Ymir from reproducing via mass sterilization.
                        However, Eren convinces Ymir to use her power to bring about the Rumbling—unleashing thousands of Wall Titans kept within Paradis' walls and leading them on a genocidal march to kill everyone outside the island.

                        The Survey Corps ally with remaining Marley forces, including Reiner and a now-freed Annie to stop Eren, 
                        and they defeat the Yeagerists before confronting Eren, though many are killed, including Hange. After Levi kills Zeke and a mysterious creature that is the source of all Titans' powers, 
                        Mikasa kills Eren, causing the power of the Titans to vanish, reverting all Titans to human form, and stripping the Titan Shifters of their powers, 
                        thereby freeing all Eldians from the curse. His death also releases memory blocks that he put on his friends, 
                        revealing that what transpired was part of Eren's plan to spare twenty percent of humanity, with Armin, Levi, Mikasa, 
                        and the others being recognized as heroes in the eyes of the world for killing him and stopping the Rumbling. 
                        Three years later, as Paradis and the rest of the world rebuilds, Armin and his allies begin peace negotiations led by Queen Historia. 
                        Mikasa buries Eren underneath a tree on a hill near Shiganshina District.[b] The tree grows over time to resemble the one where the organism that granted Ymir her Titan power lived. 
                        An unspecified amount of time after Mikasa's death from old age, a modernized Shiganshina is reduced to rubble in a war. 
                        The series ends with a boy and a dog approaching the tree, which has become surrounded by wilderness, indicating that the Titans may return.

She used her powers to make great advancements for her subjects, such as cultivating barren lands, building roads across the world, and building bridges between the mountains.[54] After 13 years, she died, and her powers were split between the Nine Titans; her power as the Founding Titan would be passed down through the Fritz family (later the Reiss family) over the next two millennia</h4>

Its most prominent characteristics were its elongated ears, fleshless jaws, and highly muscular build. Eren's Titan form had so far been shown to have fairly substantial physical strength and endurance. After ingesting a bottle labeled "Armor" from Rod Reiss's bag, Eren's Titan gained the ability to harden, allowing him to seal the hole in Wall Maria. Prolonged and repeated use of this Titan form had allowed Eren to gradually increase control over its initially unstable mental state. Its eyes were a piercing gray.

His Titan was similar in size to Bertolt's Colossus Titan, though with a more gaunt body and having unique features such as the ribs being exposed and having the windpipe visible along with two tendons stretching from the Titan's neck. Armin's Titan possessed the same abilities as his predecessor's Titan including a destructive transformation, as seen during the Raid on Liberio when the Colossus Titan destroyed the naval port and used its enhanced strength to crush the ships to ensure their destruction.

He stood at a previously unseen 17 m in height. Dark fur covered the large majority of his body, with the exception of his face, hands, feet, and torso. His arms were also elongated, almost reaching his ankles, with long fingers, hardened nails that he could use to crush rocks and parts of the Wall, and fully-functional thumbs. The proportions of his upper body were similar to that of the Colossus Titan, possessing a massive chest and small head, as well as unusually slim arms

His Titan form had thick, hardened plates of skin all over his body which served as his armor. In addition to that, the Titan was able to further harden his arms and feet, and create sharp claws. This Titan was well-built and has a hunched profile. Its only visible weaknesses were the small areas on the backs of its joints where there is no armor. Though not particularly fast, this form was strong and agile, capable of destroying a fortified Wall after a sufficient running start.

It had the stamina and focus to maintain a running pace capable of keeping up with horses over a long distance. This Titan form also had the unique ability to harden its body parts by generating a crystalline substance across chosen areas of its body, allowing it to simultaneously protect its nape and fight. Combined with Annie's refined martial arts, it could perform incredibly deadly and destructive attacks.
The Female Titan could call upon nearby Pure Titans by screaming, drawing them towards the vicinity of the Female Titan's current location.

Her head, canine-like mouth, and nose were notably oversized in contrast with her eyes and ears. She could stay transformed in this form for at least two months.

                            Falco gained the power of the Jaw Titan by inadvertently eating the previous holder, Porco Galliard. His Titan had shaggy light-colored hair with a second armored set of jaws. His Titan could harden his arms and legs, which took on a slight avian appearance, along with having a layer of feathers covering his arms.
Unlike previous Jaw Titans, Falco's possessed the ability of flight due to having ingested Zeke's spinal fluid, thus obtaining avian traits similarly to a past Beast Titan.

                            Lara Tybur's Titan form was around 15 m. Her Titan had no hair and her skin jailed the exposed areas near her eyes and mouth. She was capable of hardening her Titan form into various weapons and structures. She was skilled with the hammer and was able to defeat Eren Yeager with a single blow from it. Unlike the other intelligent Titans, she controlled her Titan from far away instead of from inside the nape, with her human body, encased in hardened flesh, stayed connected to her Titan body by a kind of "flesh cord."
